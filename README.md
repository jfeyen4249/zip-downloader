# zip-downloader
This is a script that I made to to download forms and files. Where I work we have 34 store location, and this script was created to allow us to put all the forms needed on the manager's computer.


This python script supports basic http authentication. See the comments in the script for adding usename, password, and download url.

The forms.bat file is there to quickly lauch the script on Windows.
